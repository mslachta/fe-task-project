Recommended tech stack:
* Create-react-app CLI https://create-react-app.dev/  template for typescript
* React router: https://reactrouter.com 
* Tailwind https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app
* Headless UI https://headlessui.dev/ (javascript for tailwind if you want to make for example modal window )
* Tailwind UI https://tailwindui.com/ (examples of tailwind components)
* state management over React useState ,Redux or MobX
* For managing forms, input fields and list array, you can use directly react, or on my latest projects I’ve used https://react-hook-form.com/ for form management
